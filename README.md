This project is similar to the last project in that I use object oriented programming in dart here. Therefore I will not go into detail. I learnt about one new Material widget here- the visibility widget that accepts a bool value. When a widget value is wrapped in a Visibility widget, if visibility argument is set to true it is shown on screen, it is invisible otherwise.
